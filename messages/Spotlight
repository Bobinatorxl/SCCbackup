:SCCwumpusnitro: This is the Spotlight Channel! 
We do a spotlight every day, this will give your channel some exposure.
This is all organic promotion!

:YTpartner: But we have to set some rules.
1. This is all positive. Only leave positive feedback in the comments/chat, if you insult or harass the person we will ban you.
2. You can get spotlighted once every 2 weeks
3. We do it every day around 1pm Pacific Standard Time  so if you don't get it come back tomorrow!
